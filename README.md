# Golf is a Game of Quotes

 A custom built REST Api and a simple UI built to showcase 50 of my favourite golf quotes
 
 ### About this project
 
 This was my first brush using express and the project idea came from using similar APIs like Quotable that send data on famnous quotes. As a keen golfer and general lover of the game, I wanted to create something similar but with golf specific quotes.
 
 The data is stored in a json file using an express server to handle requests. The Api can return quotes based on name and tags, or at random. All error handling is taken care of using the NPM package ('httperrors').
